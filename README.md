Instructions to run the appication:

Inside productApp folder : npm start

This is a crud application developed using mean stack.I have created angular form using formbuilder.Through this form user can add new products which will be sent to node js API and then stored in database in json format.I have used Mogodb to store the data which is a document oriented database.This data is retrived and listed on products page.If the quantity of product is less than 10 then it will show red dot for greater than 10 and less than 50 it will show yellow dot and for greater than 50 green dot.By default status of product is active. You can change the status of product by just clicking on current status and that will be also updated in database.
